    <p>I caught it bad yesterday
You hit me with a call to your place<br>
Ain't been out in a while anyway<br>
Was hoping I could catch you throwing smiles in my face</p>

<p>Romantic talking? You don't even have to try<br>
You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight<br>
Looking at the table and I see the reason why<br>
Baby, you living the life, but nigga, you ain't livin' right</p>
<p>Cocaine and drinking with your friends<br>
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend<br>
I'm not fazed, only here to sin<br>
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can</p>

<p class="favorite">Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way<br>
Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like</p>
<p>Mmm, mmm, mmm<br>
Mmm, mmm, mmm</p>
<p>Ayy, ayy<br>
I wanna sell what you're buying<br>
I wanna feel on yo' ass in Hawaii<br>
I want that jet lag from fucking and flying<br>
Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm riding</p>
<p>Oh, oh, oh, why me?<br>
A sign of the times every time that I speak<br>
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week<br>
What a time, an incline, God was shining on me</p>
<p>Now I can't leave<br>
And now I'm acting hella elite<br>
Never want the niggas that's in my league<br>
I wanna fuck the ones I envy, I envy</p>
<p>Cocaine and drinking with your friends<br>
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend<br>
I'm not fazed, only here to sin<br>
If Eve ain't in your garden, you know that you can</p>
<p class="favorite">Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>
Call me in the morning, I'll be on the way<br>
Call me when you want, call me when you need<br>
Call me out by your name, I'll be on the way like</p>
<p>Oh, call me by your name (mmm, mmm, mmm)<br>
Tell me you love me in private<br>
Call me by your name (mmm, mmm, mmm)<br>
I do not care if you lying</p>
<p>Well, I'm just feeling, mm-uh<br>
I wanna get, mm-uh<br>
I'm in my, into my, uh<br>
I'm mm, mm<br>
I'm still, mm, mm-mm, ooh</p>
